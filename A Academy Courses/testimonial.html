            This is the first time I have attended a class in this format and
            wondered how effective it would be. It was very effective and
            therefore I would definitely be interested in attending other
            classes in the same format. The instructor was very knowlegeable and
            provided a wealth of information about the current version,
            especially since the last version I used was several releases ago.

            I've never completed a course like this before and I cannot express
            how great the instructor was and the overall content of the
            material. I would defintely recommend this to my co-workers as well
            as friends. I will be looking into taking more of these classes
            through a-academy in the near future. <br />
            Thank you!

            I have twenty plus years of experience taking training courses. I am
            not easily impressed, reserved with my praise, and do not usually
            complete surveys. Your instructor was excellent, the best I've
            experienced on a software subject, and I couldn't imagine her doing
            a better job of seamlessly walking students through a breadth of
            information in a remote environment. She did a fabulous job pacing
            everything and addressing student questions. <br />
            I am very impressed

            The instructor was excellent. She was extremely knowledgeable,
            willing to help any student at anytime, with any questions. Michele
            has a passion for her students to succeed in and beyond the
            classroom. She is extremely knowledgeable and was an outstanding
            instructor for Access Advanced.
